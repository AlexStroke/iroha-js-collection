## Known issues

### Entries ordering in `BTreeMap` and `BTreeSet`

In Rust, these structs assume that items are `PartialOrd`-ordered while encoding to ensure consistency for signatures creation. The JS library doesn't provide this feature and you should put entries in the correct order by yourself.
